## Dependencies

This project is strongnly based on the [SGF4K](https://github.com/Judas/sgf4k) library for parsing
SGF files, itself being mainly inspired by [SGF4J](https://github.com/toomasr/sgf4j).

The joseki sequences played are extracted from
[Kogo's Joseki Dictionary](https://waterfire.us/joseki.htm).

The pro games played are read from [Go4Go pro game database](https://www.go4go.net/go/). Many thanks
to them for allowing this app to use their database.
