**Katachi** is a simple Android application that lets you export your **SGF files to PNG images**, allowing some visual customization along the way.

It also contains a **live wallpaper** that plays **joseki sequences** at random or recent **pro games**.

## Dependencies
This project is strongnly based on the [SGF4J](https://github.com/toomasr/sgf4j) library for parsing SGF files.

The joseki sequences played are extracted from [Kogo's Joseki Dictionary](https://waterfire.us/joseki.htm).

The pro games played are read from [Go4Go pro game database](https://www.go4go.net/go/). Many thanks to them for allowing this app to use their database.
